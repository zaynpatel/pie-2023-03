Setter, getter for solenoids - these convert electrical energy into mechanical action, I'd like to look at this more.
-> solenoids generate a magnetic field and move a "slug of metal" to open or close a valve. 
-> the solenoid is going to be doing what exactly? is it going to actuate the drill mechanism (extend into soil and activate motion) or is it going ot control the chambers
-> solenoid requires more complex hardware interaction - we are going to have C++ code running on ESP32.
Control loop will look like the following:
-> C++ code running on ESP32 will facilitate hardware component movement for solenoid and stepper motor. 
-> Stepper motor is going to engage and disengage the drill mechanism. 
    -> Stepper motor is rotating the lazy susan in a specific number of steps to align each slot with drill position. 
    -> ESP32 synchronize with solenoid's actions. ESP32 commands stepper motor to next position only after drilling (how does it know?)
    -> Send control signals to the stepper motor driver (how do these work?)
    -> Remember talking about limit switch - this is what I programmed this morning. 
-> 



Afternoon, probably only able to finish one of these
Setter, getter, activate for barrel
Setter getter activate for drill arm (stepper connected)
--
Write an arduino library that has getter and setter functions with the pins so we can easily access them and stream them to Python

digitalWrite() to whatever the GPIO pins

do stuff method - digital read to see what state and pin for input_pullup

simple set/get methods:
- PWM
- Limit Switches
- Solenoids 
- 

carriage - go to position 1, 2, 3, 4 

what do you mean for activate? 

"a -101, 101, 3, 85 a" 
str() -> parse [0], [1]
reassignment of inits with for loop 

#define vs. double variable_name
